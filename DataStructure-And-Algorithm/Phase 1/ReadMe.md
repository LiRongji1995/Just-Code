# Phase 1: Foundations (Day 1–7)

## 🎯 Goals
- Build solid foundations in core **data structures** and **basic algorithms**.
- Learn to implement and apply:
    - Arrays & Strings
    - Linked Lists
    - Stacks & Queues
    - Hash Tables
    - Two Pointers
    - Binary Search
    - Sorting Algorithms
- Develop the habit of solving problems first, then reading book sections for reinforcement.
- Start maintaining **minimal summary notes** (key idea + complexity + template code).

---

## ⏰ Daily Routine (5 hrs)
- **LeetCode practice (3h)**: 4–6 problems
- **Book study (1h)**: Read relevant section from *Algorithms, 4th Edition*
- **Note-taking (30min)**: Summarize key insights
- **Review (30min)**: Revisit yesterday’s mistakes/difficult problems

---

## 📚 Reference (Algorithms, 4th Edition)
- **Chapter 1: Fundamentals**
    - Basic programming model
    - Bags, Queues, and Stacks
- **Chapter 2: Sorting**
    - Elementary sorts
    - Mergesort, Quicksort
- **Chapter 3: Searching**
    - Symbol tables
    - Binary search

*(Focus only on the sections that directly support your problem-solving.)*

## 🧩 LeetCode Topics to Focus
- `Array`
- `String`
- `Linked List`
- `Stack`
- `Queue`
- `Hash Table`
- `Two Pointers`
- `Binary Search`
- `Sorting`

---

## ✅ Suggested Problem Mix (per day)
- 2 Easy (warm-up, syntax/ideas)
- 2 Medium (application of the day’s topic)
- 1 Hard (stretch problem, ok to struggle)

---

## 📝 Notes Guideline
For each new concept/problem:
- **Name**: e.g., "Binary Search"
- **Key Idea**: Divide search interval by half each step
- **Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Template Code**: short snippet
- **Usage**: Applicable when array is sorted

Keep it concise—goal is quick recall, not writing a textbook.

---

## 🎬 At the End of Week 1
- You should feel comfortable with arrays, linked lists, stacks/queues, hashing, and sorting.
- You should have a **personal cheatsheet** for basic data structures and algorithms.
- You should be solving **medium-level problems in ~20–30 minutes** without constant reference.
